# BlogCTL commands

Run `blogctl help` to inspect your installed executable. Source dispatch is in [`cmd/main.go`](../../cmd/main.go); the CLI and UI do not expose identical workflows.

## Working directory

| Commands | Where to run |
| --- | --- |
| `help`, `install`, `uninstall` | No engine checkout required |
| `social ...` | Uses local configuration and explicit content inputs; see [Buffer guide](../guide/social-publishing.md) |
| `sync`, `toutiao` | Content checkout, or explicit workspace environment variables |
| `doctor`, `dev`, `preview`, `build`, `check`, `test`, `site`, `search`, `ai-search`, `diagrams` | Inside the Inkerio engine checkout |

For `sync`, `BLOG_CONTENT_ROOT` and `BLOGCTL_ENGINE_ROOT` override workspace discovery. Otherwise the CLI looks for the current content checkout and a sibling engine named `ThinkerQAQ.github.io`; from the engine it can find a sibling `blog-content`. Settings paths saved by the UI are not a substitute for these CLI discovery rules. `BLOGCTL_DATA_DIR` separately chooses persistent configuration/state and must be absolute.

## Site and maintenance commands

| Command | Operation |
| --- | --- |
| `blogctl doctor` | Inspect Node/npm/Git and OS |
| `blogctl dev` | Run the npm demo development flow; reassembles the public template |
| `blogctl preview` | Serve existing `dist/` |
| `blogctl check` / `test` | Run npm check / full test flow |
| `blogctl build` | Build currently assembled site content |
| `blogctl site assemble --content-root PATH` | Replace generated content from a selected checkout |
| `blogctl site build [--content-root PATH]` | Optionally assemble, build site and URL inventory, then Pagefind |
| `blogctl diagrams [plantuml\|drawio]` | Render all diagrams or the selected supported subcommand |
| `blogctl search build\|inventory\|submit\|audit\|notify` | Build/read inventories and perform provider tasks |
| `blogctl ai-search prepare\|sync\|verify` | Prepare and synchronize optional AI Search content |

Search submission requires explicit providers and URL scope (`--all` or `--urls-file` for IndexNow/Baidu). `search submit` has no dry-run mode and can send real requests. Check configuration and command-specific options in [`cmd/search.go`](../../cmd/search.go) before a live submission. `inventory --json` reads local built output; it does not submit URLs.

The engineering-only `go run ./tools/blogctl/cmd/maint verify|build|package` runs from the engine root. `verify` installs Node dependencies and runs the BlogCTL test set; `package` writes binaries, Extension ZIP and checksums without publishing a release. See [engine commands](../../../../docs/reference/commands.md).

## Article sync

```bash
blogctl sync --article sample-article --platforms devto --dry-run
```

| Flag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--article SLUG` | Root article slug; repeat for specific articles |
| `--all` | All published articles; mutually exclusive with `--article` |
| `--platforms p1,p2` | Required registered platform IDs |
| `--dry-run` | Compile locally; no remote article writes or publishing-asset upload |
| `--changed` | Use changed-content filtering in the sync workflow |
| `--draft` | Legacy sync draft option; not a remote target selector |

Dry-run does not need a browser connection, but may install Node dependencies and persist workspace roots locally. It returns a success/failure result and does not promise a rendered preview file. Live `sync` uses the Bridge's `draft` workflow; the explicit Create/Update target controls documented for the UI are not CLI `sync` flags. Use the UI to choose a specific remote update target.

Registered IDs are in [`platform/capabilities.go`](../../platform/capabilities.go). Registration alone does not make every action available: Toutiao is hidden in the normal UI, and OSChina/Hashnode explicit publishing is disabled.

## Social and experimental commands

`blogctl social channels|source|create|list|show|stage|reconcile|publish` manages local drafts and Buffer operations. [The guide](../guide/social-publishing.md) defines inputs and revision checks.

`toutiao probe --har FILE` is a developer diagnostic, not the recommended publication path. HAR files can contain account credentials; keep captures out of the repository and use the normal supported UI for everyday work.
