# BlogCTL

[简体中文](README_ZH.md) · [Documentation](docs/index.md) · [Releases](https://github.com/ThinkerQAQ/ThinkerQAQ.github.io/releases/latest)

BlogCTL is Inkerio's companion Go application. It assembles content, compiles articles for publishing platforms, submits URLs to search engines and runs the local Bridge used by the browser Extension and Web Console.

The Extension accesses your logged-in browser sessions; the Bridge runs local jobs. Platform support varies: creating a draft, editing a draft and updating a published article are separate capabilities.

## First use

From an engine checkout:

```bash
go run ./tools/blogctl/cmd help
go run ./tools/blogctl/cmd doctor
```

For a desktop installation, download the **OS/architecture-specific ZIP bundle** (executable + MIT LICENSE) and the separate Extension ZIP from Releases, and verify their hashes using `SHA256SUMS`. Standalone executables remain available for existing users. Extract them into persistent directories, run the executable's `install` command and load the unpacked Extension in Edge or Chrome. On Windows:

```powershell
& C:\software\Coding\blogctl\blogctl-windows-amd64.exe install
```

Keep the adjacent `Data/` directory during upgrades. See [Quick Start](docs/quick-start.md) for storage locations on other systems and [new-machine setup](docs/tutorial/first-run-on-new-machine.md) for screenshots.

## Publishing

Select a local article and platforms in the Console. Existing-article detection is optional and runs only when requested. A match removes that platform from batch creation; detection failure does not prevent creation. Review remote state before retrying a failed creation.

Updating requires an explicit remote article or draft ID. Medium published-article edits are saved in its editor and require a manual publish action. See [workflows](docs/guide/workflows.md) for the full operation and retry rules.

Short-form publishing through Buffer has a separate [review and publication workflow](docs/guide/social-publishing.md).

## Development

From the engine root:

```bash
go run ./tools/blogctl/cmd/maint verify
go run ./tools/blogctl/cmd/maint build
go run ./tools/blogctl/cmd/maint package
```

Build output goes to `.build/out/`. Packaging produces six platform executables, the Extension ZIP and checksums. Read the [root rules](../../AGENTS.md) and [BlogCTL rules](AGENTS.md) before modifying the code.

## ChatGPT / MCP

Run `blogctl -mcp-stdio` from the installed machine to expose the existing Bridge as MCP over STDIO. The browser Extension continues to own browser sessions; no separate publisher or public HTTP endpoint is created. See [MCP integration](docs/MCP.md).

The MCP tool `upload_image_to_r2` sanitizes images locally before uploading with the existing R2 credentials, and returns content-versioned Markdown URLs. Configure `image_upload_roots` in private TOML; see [MCP image uploads](docs/MCP.md#private-image-upload-to-r2).
